The Standard Helper application is designed to assist students, chemists, and wet-lab technicians in quickly developing dilution schemes. While still in development, the current version of the project offers functionality where users select available laboratory glassware, desired standard concentrations, and defines constraints.

Once processed, dictionaries are generated containing key-value pairs representing individual standard concentrations specified by the user, along with a list of instances of the "Dilutions" class. This class encapsulates possible dilutions that achieve target concentrations given provided constraints. It also includes information such as volumetric pipette, volumetric flask, associated dilution factor, stock standard concentration, and calculated volumetric error related to the dilution preparation instance. This is intended to provide the user with all possible ways to prepare desired solutions, given constraints of the user or laboratory.

Ongoing development focuses on providing outputs for users through GUI elements and document generation. These developments aim to offer users visualizations of possible dilution schemes and to generate laboratory procedures based on defined constraints. Additional developments will focus on implementing a backtracking algorithm to minimize volumetric error, within defined constraints.
