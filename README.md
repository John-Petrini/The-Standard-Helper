The standard helper is a application intended to help students, chemists or wet-lab technicians develop dilution schemes rapidly. 

While still under development, the current state of the project provides functionality. Within the GUI the user must select available laboratory glassware, intended standard concentrations, and define constraints. Once processed, dictionaries are generated where {key, value} pairs represent individual standard concentrations which were specified by the user, and a list of instances of the "Dilutions" class. The "Dilutions" class encapsulates possible dilutions which achieve target concentrations given provided contraints, and encasulate a variety of information, including volumetric pipette, volumetric flask, associated dilution factor, stock standard concentration, and calculated volumetric error related to the instance of dilution preparation.

Current development is focused on providing outputs for the user in terms of both GUI elements and document generation. The focus of these developments will be to provide the user with a visualization of possible dilutions schemes, and to generate a laboratory procedure based on defined constraints.
