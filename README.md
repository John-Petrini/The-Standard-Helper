The standard helper is a application intended to help students, chemists or wet-lab technicians develop dilution schemes rapidly. 

The user selects glassware (volumetric pipettes, volumetric flasks) available in their laboratory space, defines constraints on the dilution scheme, such as target concentrations, and the application produces a list of all pertinent potential dilutions which accomplish the preparation of the intended target concentrations. 

Future updates will allow for the review of stock standard concentrations which can accomplish dilutions per the user defined contraints. The user will then select the desired stock solution concentration, the desired volume of each individual standard within the standard curve, and a laboratory procedure which describes, in totality, the lab work in order to execute the desired preparations will be printed. Additionally, the volumetric error of each selected dilution will be calculated and reported.
