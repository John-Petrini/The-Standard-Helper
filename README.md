The standard helper is a application intended to help students, chemists or wet-lab technicians develop dilution schemes rapidly. 

The user selects glassware (volumetric pipettes, volumetric flasks) available in their laboratory space, defines constraints on the dilution scheme, such as target concentrations, and the application produces a list of all pertinent potential dilutions which accomplish the preparation of the intended target concentrations. 

Future updates will allow for the review of stock standard concentrations, and subsequent dilutions of working standards which satisfy the provided contraints.
